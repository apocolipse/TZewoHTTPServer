About
========

TZewoHTTPServer is a CSP based HTTPServer for [Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift) using [Zewo's](https://github.com/zewo/zewo) CSP based HTTPServer.  It uses the Swift 3 native thrift library (located [here](https://github.com/apocolipse/thrift-swift)).

Usage
========
To use TZewoHTTPServer, you must already have a Thrift service that you want to serve.

Adding dependancy
--------
Add the following in `Package.swift`
```swift
  dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/apocolipse/TZewoHTTPServer.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 1),
  ]
```

Creating and starting a server
--------
To create a server, you must have a concrete Service to serve, and provide classes for protocols and processors used
```swift
let service = MyService()

let server = try? TZewoHTTPServer(port: 9090,
                                  service: service,
                                  inProtocol: TBinaryProtocol.self,
                                  outProtocol: TBinaryProtocol.self,
                                  processor: MyServiceProcessor.self)

try? server?.serve()                                  
```



Questions and Support
=====================
I can usually be found floating around #thrift and #swift on FreeNode, as well as on Zewo's official [Slack](http://slack.zewo.io/), feel free to bombard with questions.
